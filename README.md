# Reusable units and components derived on top of closure library.

The repo is a collection of helper functions, utitlities and components that have been used in several projects and are abstract enough to allow for further reuse.

### Hot to use?

Please read [this](https://github.com/pstjvn/closure-seed-project/blob/master/README.md)

### Q&A:

__Library is too big__

I don't care, neither should you (assuming you are using the compiler in
advanced mode)

**Feature 'X' is missing (or feature 'Y' is broken)**

File an issue (in github). Or better yet make a pull request.

**Is it free to be used?**

Yes, all parts and the project itself is free as in free beer.

**Licensing information is missing**

I know, I have been alerted about it, but unfortunately I am no layer and I cannot make my mind on which license if best for this use case. Basically use it as you find fit and if you cite the source I will be thankful.
